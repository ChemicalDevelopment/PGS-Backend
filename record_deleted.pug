    p This is an email from PGS (Prime Generator Search), letting you know that your record:
    p #{old_eq}
    p #{old_record}
    br
    p Was found to be incorrect by our verifier.
    p The record was deleted from your account due to the lack of consecutive and distinct primes.
    p We do not store polynomials with less than 40 distinct primes and 60 consecutive.
    p Please upgrade to the latest version of PGS ( chemicaldevelopment.us/pgs ), and see if that fixes this problem.
    p If you continue to have issues, you can email me at: info@chemicaldevelopment.us , or my primary email: brown.cade@gmail.com
